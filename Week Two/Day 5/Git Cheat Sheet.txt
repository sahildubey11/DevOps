A Git Cheat Sheet is a quick-reference guide that covers all essential Git commands used in development and DevOps workflows. It helps developers manage version control, collaboration, branching, history, and deployment efficiently.

🔹 1. Git Installation & Version Check

Git can be installed on Windows, macOS, and Linux using platform-specific package managers.
After installation, git --version is used to verify Git is correctly installed.

🔹 2. Git Configuration & Setup

Before using Git, user identity is configured:

Username & email identify commit authorship

Color UI improves readability

Aliases shorten long commands

Configuration can be viewed or retrieved using config list/get commands

✔ This setup ensures commits are properly tracked and readable.

🔹 3. Initializing a Repository

Git repositories can be:

Created locally using git init

Cloned from remote using git clone

A specific branch can also be cloned directly

✔ This is the starting point of version control.

🔹 4. Basic Git Workflow Commands

Core daily-use commands include:

git add → stage files

git status → check repo state

git diff → compare changes

git commit → save a snapshot

git restore / reset → undo changes

git rm / mv → remove or rename files

✔ These commands manage the full edit → stage → commit lifecycle.

🔹 5. Commit Message Standards (Conventional Commits)

Modern Git practices use structured commit messages like:

feat: new feature

fix: bug fix

docs: documentation

refactor: code improvement

test:, style:, perf:, ci: etc.

✔ Helps in clean history, automation, and CI/CD pipelines.

🔹 6. Branching & Merging

Git supports parallel development using branches:

Create, list, delete branches

Switch or create branches

Merge branches together

View commit history across branches

Temporarily save work using stash

Mark releases using tags

✔ Enables team collaboration without conflicts.

🔹 7. Remote Repository Operations

Remote commands allow collaboration:

fetch → download updates

pull → fetch + merge

push → upload commits

remote add/remove/rename → manage connections

✔ Keeps local and remote repositories in sync.

🔹 8. Comparing & Reviewing Code

Git provides powerful review tools:

git show → inspect commits

git diff → compare changes

git blame → find who changed what

git log → track full history with filters

✔ Essential for debugging and code reviews.

🔹 9. Managing History Safely

Git history can be managed using:

git revert → safe undo (new commit)

git rebase → clean linear history

git reset → move HEAD (local use)

✔ Helps maintain a clean and meaningful commit timeline.

🔹 10. Git Reflog (Recovery Tool)

git reflog tracks all HEAD movements, even deleted commits.
It allows:

Recovering lost commits

Undoing hard resets

Restoring previous states

✔ Acts as a safety net in Git.
