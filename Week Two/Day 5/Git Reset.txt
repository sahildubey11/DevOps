Git reset is used to move your project back to an earlier state by manipulating three Git levels:

HEAD → points to the latest commit

Index (Staging Area) → files ready to commit

Working Directory → actual local files

👉 What Git Reset is used for

Unstage files added by mistake

Undo commits

Discard local changes

Clean up commit history (mainly for local branches)

🔹 Git Reset Modes

Soft Reset (--soft)

Moves HEAD only

Changes stay staged

Working directory unchanged
✔ Use when you want to redo a commit message or combine commits

Mixed Reset (--mixed) (default)

Moves HEAD + clears staging area

Changes stay in working directory
✔ Best for unstaging files

Hard Reset (--hard)

Moves HEAD + index + working directory

All changes lost ❌
✔ Use carefully (irreversible)

🔹 Common Commands

git reset → unstage files

git reset --soft <commit> → undo commit, keep changes staged

git reset --hard <commit> → delete all changes and commits

⚠️ Not safe for shared branches because it rewrites history.

🔹 Git Revert — Summary

Git revert is the safe way to undo a commit.

👉 How Git Revert works

Does NOT delete the original commit

Creates a new commit that reverses the changes

Keeps commit history intact

✔ Best for shared/collaborative branches

🔹 Steps to Revert a Commit

Find commit hash → git log

Revert commit → git revert <commit-hash>

Resolve conflicts (if any)

Edit commit message (optional)

Push changes → git push

🔹 Useful Revert Options

--no-commit → apply revert without committing

-m 1 → revert a merge commit

--no-edit → keep default commit message
