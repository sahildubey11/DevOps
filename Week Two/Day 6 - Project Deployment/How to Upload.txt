Share your work with others

Collaborate with teammates

Track changes using version control

🔹 Overall Approach

Create a GitHub repository

Add project files

Stage and commit changes

Push changes to GitHub

🔹 Step-by-Step Process with Git Commands
🔹 Step 1: Create a Repository on GitHub

Log in to GitHub

Click New Repository

Give a name (e.g., my-project)

Do NOT initialize with README

Copy the HTTPS repository link

Example:

https://github.com/username/my-project.git

🔹 Step 2: Install Git & Clone Repository

If Git is not installed, install it first.
Then clone your repository:

git clone https://github.com/username/my-project.git


✔ This creates a local copy of the repository on your system.

🔹 Step 3: Navigate to Project Folder
cd my-project


✔ Now you are inside your local Git repository.

🔹 Step 4: Check Repository Status
git status


👉 Shows:

Untracked files (in red)

Modified files

Staged files

🔹 Step 5: Add Files to Staging Area

Add all files:

git add .


Or add a specific file:

git add README.md


✔ Staging is the step before committing changes.

🔹 Step 6: Commit Your Changes
git commit -m "Initial project upload"


✔ A commit saves a snapshot of your project.

🔹 Step 7: Verify Remote Repository
git remote -v


✔ Confirms your local repo is linked to GitHub.

🔹 Step 8: Push Changes to GitHub
git push origin master


(or main, depending on branch name)

✔ Your project is now uploaded to GitHub 🎉

🔹 Final Result

All files appear in your GitHub repository

Commit time and message are visible

Project is now accessible online

You can update, revert, or collaborate anytime
