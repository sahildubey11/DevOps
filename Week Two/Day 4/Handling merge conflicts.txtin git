🔹 What is a Git Conflict?

A Git conflict happens when Git can’t automatically merge changes because:

The same file

The same line(s)

Were modified differently in two branches

👉 Git gets confused and asks YOU to decide.

🔹 When Do Git Conflicts Occur?

Common situations:

Merging branches

git merge feature-branch


Pulling changes

git pull origin main


Rebasing

git rebase main

🔹 Simple Example of a Conflict
Situation:

Branch main edits line 5

Branch feature also edits line 5

Git cannot choose → ❌ Conflict

🔹 How Git Shows a Conflict (Very Important)

Inside the file 👇

<<<<<<< HEAD
This is code from main branch
=======
This is code from feature branch
>>>>>>> feature

Meaning:

<<<<<<< HEAD → current branch code

======= → separator

>>>>>>> feature → incoming branch code

🔹 Steps to Resolve a Git Conflict
✅ Step 1: Open the conflicted file

Git will tell:

CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in file.txt

✅ Step 2: Decide what to keep

Options:

Keep HEAD code

Keep incoming code

Combine both

Rewrite clean version

✂️ Remove conflict markers after editing.

✅ Step 3: Mark as resolved
git add file.txt

✅ Step 4: Complete merge
git commit


🎉 Conflict resolved!

🔹 Git Conflict Resolution Using Commands
Command	Use
git status	See conflicted files
git diff	View differences
git add <file>	Mark resolved
git commit	Finish merge
🔹 Abort a Conflict (If You Panic 😅)
Abort merge:
git merge --abort

Abort rebase:
git rebase --abort

🔹 Best Practices to Avoid Conflicts

✔ Pull frequently

git pull origin main


✔ Keep commits small
✔ Communicate with team
✔ Avoid editing same file/lines
✔ Use feature branches

🔹 Conflict in CI/CD (DevOps Point 📌)

Conflicts break pipelines

Code won’t build if merge fails

Teams resolve conflicts before deployment
