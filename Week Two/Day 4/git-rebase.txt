Git Rebase is a Git command used to integrate changes from one branch into another by moving your commits to the latest point (tip) of the target branch.
Unlike Git merge, which creates a new merge commit and retains the commit history as a branching tree,
rebase rewrites your commit history to make it look like your work started from the most recent updates on the target branch.

Syntax:
  git checkout <feature-branch>
  git rebase <base-branch>
In this syntax:

  <feature-branch> is the branch with the changes you want to rebase.
  <base-branch> is the branch you want to rebase your changes onto, typically main or master.

When to Use Git Rebase
  Imagine you are working on a feature (like “adding a login button”) while your teammate adds something else (like “fixing a bug”) to the main project.
  Later, you want to update your work so it includes all the latest changes from the main project before you finish.

Think of it like this:
  1. You are writing a paragraph for a report.
  2. While you are writing, someone else updates the report with new lines.
  3. git rebase lets you move your paragraph to the end of the latest version of the report, so it looks like you wrote it after those new lines.

What Happens During Rebase?
 1.  Git temporarily removes your changes.
 2.  Then it adds the latest work from the branch you rebased onto.
 3.  Then it reapplies your changes on top of that.
 4.  It creates new commit versions of your changes (called C′ and D′).
