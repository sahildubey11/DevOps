Git blame is a Git command used to track who last modified each line of a file, along with when and in which commit the change was made. It is mainly used for debugging, code review, and understanding code history at a line level.

🔹 What information does git blame show?

For each line in a file, it displays:

Commit ID – the commit where the line was last changed

Author name / email – who made the change

Timestamp – when the change was made

Line number and code content

🔹 Basic Syntax
git blame <file-name>

🔹 How to Use Git Blame (Workflow)

Initialize or clone a Git repository.

Navigate to the repository directory.

Run git blame on a file to see line-by-line history.

Use the commit ID from the output to inspect detailed changes using:

git log -p <commit-id>

🔹 Important Git Blame Options

View raw timestamp

git blame -t <file-name>


View a specific range of lines

git blame -L start,end <file-name>


Show author email instead of name

git blame -e <file-name>


View changes not older than a specific time

git blame --since=3.months <file-name>


Filter out older commits

git blame --since=3.months <file-name> | grep -v '^\^'

🔹 Understanding the Output

Each line is annotated with its last modifying commit.

Commits starting with ^ indicate changes older than the given time range.

Helps identify who to contact for a particular piece of code.

🔹 GUI Alternative

Git hosting platforms like GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket provide a Blame view in the UI, which visually shows:

Author

Commit

Timestamp

Line-by-line modification history

🔹 Why Git Blame is Important (DevOps View)

Helps debug issues quickly

Improves accountability

Useful in large teams and CI/CD workflows

Works well with other Git commands for deep analysis
