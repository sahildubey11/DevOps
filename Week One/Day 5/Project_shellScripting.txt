How to See CPU Resource Usage Using Python Script
This project is part of a basic DevOps course where we build practical tools using Python script. Here we’ll learn how to check CPU usage using Python,
along with simple command-line tools you can use anytime because keeping an eye on your CPU usage is one of the easiest ways to check if
your computer or server is working fine or overloaded.


Prerequisites
Python 3.x installed (you can check by running python3 --version)
psutil library (used to monitor system health)
smtplib (Python lib): To send email alerts via Gmail/SMTP
Gmail/SMTP account: To send alerts to your inbox.
Steps to see CPU Resource Usage Using Python Script
This Python project helps you keep an eye on your server’s health and sends you an email alert when CPU or memory usage gets too high.



How It Works
Here are the working how the python script work

The script checks CPU and memory usage by using the psutil library
Than it captures the CPU usage as a percentage (e.g., 72%) and RAM usage as a percentage (e.g., 68%).
If values go beyond your set limit, it sends an email
Every time it checks the system, it compares current usage against these limits.
It also logs every check in a log file like the script saves a line like this in server_monitor.log file
This process repeats every 5 minutes
Conclusion
By building this Python-based Server Resource Monitoring and Email Alert System, you’ve taken the first real step toward automating DevOps tasks.

You now know how to check CPU and memory usage in real time.
You’ve worked with useful Python tools like psutil, smtplib, and logging.
You’ve learned how to send automatic alerts before performance issues crash your server.

Step 1: Enable Gmail App Password
If you’re using a Gmail account:

Go to https://myaccount.google.com/not-supported
Select "Mail" + "Other" → Name it "Python Monitor"
Copy the 16-character app password
Replace this in the script: EMAIL_PASSWORD = "your_app_password"

Step 2: Run the Script
In your terminal, go to the folder where the script is saved, then run:
python3 resource_monitor.py



What happens:

CPU and memory are checked
If they cross the limit, an email is sent
The result is also saved in a log file
This repeats every 5 minutes
