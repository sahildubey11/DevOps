DevOps is a combination of two words: "Development" and "Operations."

The main idea of DevOps is to improve the software delivery process. We achieve this by software release automation, continuous monitoring/logging and testing. The goals of DevOps are:

Faster and continuous software releases.
Reduces manual errors through automation.
Built-in Monitoring, detect failures or issues during delivery or in production.
Automate testing throughout the software delivery process.






Stages of DevOps are:

Build Stage
1. Developers write and organize code, using version control tools like Git to track changes.

2. The system automatically compiles and packages the code into a deployable format.

3. Dependencies (external libraries and tools) are included to ensure smooth operation.

4. Common Tools: Git, Jenkins, GitLab CI/CD, Gradle, Maven.

Test Stage
1. The software undergoes thorough testing to catch bugs and security risks before release.

2. Different testing methods include:

Unit Testing: Checks individual pieces of code.
Integration Testing: Ensures different parts of the system work together.
Performance Testing: Measures speed and scalability.
Security Testing: Identifies potential vulnerabilities.
3. Automated tests help ensure the software is stable before moving forward.

4. Common Tools: Selenium, JUnit, TestNG, SonarQube.

Release Stage
1. The software is deployed in a staging environment to simulate real-world conditions.

2. If everything checks out, the software is rolled out to production using deployment strategies like:

Blue-Green Deployment: Two identical environments switch traffic for a seamless update.
Canary Deployment: A small percentage of users get the new version first, ensuring safety.
Rolling Updates: The update is gradually pushed out to all users.
3. Common Tools: Docker, Kubernetes, Ansible, Helm, ArgoCD.

Continuous Feedback Loop
A key aspect of DevOps is learning from real-world performance and using that feedback to improve future releases.

Monitoring & Logging: Track system performance and detect errors.
User Feedback: Gather insights from customers to enhance features.
Incident Response: Alert systems notify teams of failures for quick fixes.
Process Improvement: Teams analyze past releases to optimize automation and workflow.
Common Tools: Prometheus, Grafana, ELK Stack, Datadog, New Relic.
